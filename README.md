## Day 1 Reflection
I struggled a bit with the logic of Question 5 but the other questions gave me a good introduction to Pandas and Numpy.
## Day 2 Reflection 
I had some trouble with using Graphviz to visualize the random forest results so I had to use Stack Overflow to know how to fix that error, but the rest of the day's work was okay for me.
## Day 3 Reflection
I had a lot of trouble understanding the brief for Question 1 and couldn't really figure out how to manipulate the hyperparameters of the neural networks. It occurs to me that neural networks with so many connections might be impossible to understand unlike decision trees, where we can clearly see how the AI made certain decisions. 
## Day 4 Reflection
I found today's work pretty fun and I learned a lot more about what can be done with tensors than I thought was possible.
## Day 5 Reflection
It was really fun to see how to manually code neural networks, but I don't know for sure if the code for Question 7 worked because of the errors caused by the train() function.
## Day 6 Reflection
I struggled a lot with making the filters and I'm still not sure how to do the "shift" filter in Question 2.
## Day 7 Reflection
The game provided me with a new and interactive way of learning about algorithmic bias.
## Day 8 Reflection
I found the questions fun and learned more about CNNs and image classification, but I struggled a bit with the visualizing layers part.
