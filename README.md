## Day 1 Reflection
I struggled a bit with the logic of Question 5 but the other questions gave me a good introduction to Pandas and Numpy.
## Day 2 Reflection 
I had some trouble with using Graphviz to visualize the random forest results so I had to use Stack Overflow to know how to fix that error, but the rest of the day's work was okay for me.
## Day 3 Reflection
I had a lot of trouble understanding the brief for Question 1 and couldn't really figure out how to manipulate the hyperparameters of the neural networks. It occurs to me that neural networks with so many connections might be impossible to understand unlike decision trees, where we can clearly see how the AI made certain decisions. 
## Day 4 Reflection
I found today's work pretty fun and I learned a lot more about what can be done with tensors than I thought was possible.
